### Who is it For?

This guide is for all clinic staff, including:

## 2. Core Features & Sections

The application is organized into several key sections, each designed to handle a specific aspect of our clinic's workflow.

### The Dashboard

The Dashboard is your command center. When you first log in, you'll see a high-level overview of what's happening in the clinic, including today's appointments, recent patient activity, and important notifications. Itâ€™s the best place to start your day to get a quick snapshot of the clinic's status.

### Calendar & Appointments

This is the heart of the clinic's scheduling.

*   **View Schedules:** You can view a comprehensive calendar showing all booked appointments for different rooms, doctors, and technicians.
*   **Book & Manage Appointments:** Easily create new appointments, edit existing ones, and view detailed information for each booking. The system helps you avoid scheduling conflicts by showing real-time availability.
*   **Close Days:** You can mark specific days as "closed" for holidays or special events. This prevents any new appointments from being booked on those dates and is clearly visible on the calendar.

### Patient Management

This section is your complete directory of all patients.

*   **Patient Profiles:** Create and manage detailed patient records, including contact information and medical notes.
*   **Photo Albums:** Securely store and organize patient photos, such as before-and-after shots for procedures, categorized for easy access.
*   **Appointment History:** Quickly look up a patient's entire history of past and future appointments.

### Staff Management

Efficiently manage all clinic personnel.

*   **Staff Profiles & Schedules:** View profiles for all staff members, including their roles and contact information.
*   **Individual Calendars:** Each staff member has their own calendar to manage their availability and view their assigned appointments.

### Human Resources (HR)

A dedicated area for recruitment and staff onboarding.

*   **Candidate Tracking:** Keep a record of job applicants, their details, and the status of their application.
*   **Interview Invitations:** Send and manage interview invitations directly through the system.

### Communication Hub

Stay connected with patients and colleagues without leaving the application.

*   **Integrated Email:** A full-featured email client is built right in. You can compose, send, and receive emails, making it easy to communicate with patients about their appointments or follow-ups.
*   **Internal Messaging:** A secure, internal messaging system allows for quick and easy communication between staff members. You can view conversations and send direct messages.

### Administration

This section contains the tools for managing the system's core settings. Access is typically limited to administrators.

*   **Manage System Settings:** From here, you can manage user accounts, define the types of procedures offered at the clinic, add or remove clinic rooms, and configure other foundational settings that keep the application running smoothly.
